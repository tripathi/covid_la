The Jupyter notebook creates a choropleth map of Los Angeles County, showing the case counts for COVID-19 by neighborhood.

Included are data files retrieved from the public health department website and saved as CSV files.  Note that the totals do not necessarily add up, and this is a direct transcription of values on the site.
